# PERSONAL WORD CENSOR v1.3

[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](https://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=4176)

------

## Introduction
This mod allows each user to specify words to censor and their replacements, much like the admin panel does.  The only difference is this mod's censor list is user-specific, not global (as the admin panel is).  Admin's are also allowed to see each user's personal word censor list.

## Profile Settings
Under **Profile** => **Modify Profile**, there is a new entry called **Personal Censored Words**.  There you can specify the words to censor and the replacements for each censored word.

## Admin Settings
There are no admin settings for this mod.  To disable, you must uninstall the mod.
