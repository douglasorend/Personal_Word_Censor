[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod allows each user to specify words to censor and their replacements, much like the admin panel does.  The only difference is this mod's censor list is user-specific, not global (as the admin panel is).  Admin's are also allowed to see each user's personal word censor list.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Profile Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
Under [b]Profile[/b] => [b]Modify Profile[/b], there is a new entry called [b]Personal Censored Words[/b].  There you can specify the words to censor and the replacements for each censored word.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
There are no admin settings for this mod.  To disable, you must uninstall the mod.
